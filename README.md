Project Name: Blog App- MERN Stack Application

A full-stack blog application built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, register and login securely, and enjoy a smooth, responsive UI for managing personal content.

This project reflects my deep interest and passion for **backend development**, building scalable, secure, and maintainable systems that power real-world applications.

‚úÖ Designed and Developmed the server side Logic using **Node.Js** runtime evnironment and one of its frameworks **Express.Js**\
‚úÖ Created a fully functional **RESTful API** architecture  
‚úÖ Engineered the **MongoDB schema** for users and blog posts using **Mongoose**  
‚úÖ Ensured robust **error handling**, **validation**, and **API responses**  
‚úÖ Used **RestClient** for testing and created API collections for easy debugging  
‚úÖ Passionate about **writing clean code**, **following REST principles**, and **learning best practices**
